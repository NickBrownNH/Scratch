Before running this program, watch the video titled WatchMeFirst before continuing first.

To use this program, you want to run the main.py file.

This will open the start-up window where you can press start to begin entering the values asked:
Enter Your Height(cm): Enter here how tall you are in centimeters
Enter Your Distance from Camera(cm): Enter here the distance you will be away from the camera in centimeters (150 - 200 
    centimeters works best)
Enter Your Weight(kg): Enter your weight in kilograms here
Enter The Weight You're Holding(kg): Enter the weight of the object you're holding in the simulation in kilograms. If you aren't 
    holding anything, you can simply just leave the value as 0.
Developer Mode: Check the Box if you'd like to have all the values displayed in the terminal as the program is running
Enable Graph: Check the Box if you'd like to have the bicep force to angle values plotted on a graph as you are running

Once you have inputted all of the values you will be using, you can click the next button.

The next window that will open up will be asking about the simulation's settings before it's run:
Time To Get In Position(sec): Enter the number of seconds it will take you to get in position. (This is important because once you 
    are in position you have to try to stay in the same position as when the program first began.)
Time Simulation Is Active: Enter the number of seconds the program will be running for. When the program reaches it's the amount of 
    time it's been asked to run, the program will terminate but the window won't close.

Next, when you are ready to start the simulation and have inputted the values needed, you can press the start button on the window.
Once you press the start button, the count down to the program init sequence will begin. During this time you want to get to the 
    distance away from the camera you previously put in. Once you get to your chosen location, you want to leave your arms by your 
    sides and make sure you look directly at the camera when the program starts.

Once the program begins, you'll be asked to raise your arms and spread them out as far as you can, to the point where your shoulders, 
    elbows, and wrists are in the circles on the screen. Once all the points on your joints are in the circles, the program will move over
    to step 2 of the initializing stage.

Once the second stage of the setup begins, you will be asked to raise your elbows up to the same level as your shoulders with your wrists
    pointing upward, with your arms bent in like you are blocking a punch. Once all points are in their appropriate circles, the third stage 
    will begin.

Once the third stage of the setup begins, you will be asked to leave your arms by your side in a relaxed position. Once all points are in 
    the appropriate circles, the setup will be complete and the program will begin running the data collection period.

This period will stop once the time active time entered has been reached. Once this time has been reached, you can close the window and run
    again as needed.
